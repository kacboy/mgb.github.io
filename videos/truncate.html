                        <p>This is a narrative short film I worked on as a
                            university course project with a group of five students
                            over
                            five
                            weeks. I directed, edited, and co-wrote the film, I
                            also
                            filmed most of the interior scenes. It was
                            very well received with 8 nominations
                            among the 30~ films that semester, and we won Best
                            Film
                            and Best Editing.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This project really took off based on my idea that
                            filming in an enclosed space with very little/no
                            light would be challenging and fun. The film Buried
                            (2010) was a core inspiration for knowing what
                            was possible with this type of film.
                            If Hollywood could follow one character in a coffin
                            for
                            90 minutes, we could do at least 5 minutes.

                        <p>Two years after its initial release, the film was entered
                            into the <a
